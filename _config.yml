  Hi, I am Priyanka Bulla, currently pursuing a masters in Information Technology and Management. Having taken up courses like Data Analytics, Data Warehousing, Data Mining, and Project Management, I am more inclined towards working with Data, designing and delivering analytics and insights using various analytical tools to enable reporting and planning.
  
  I will be graduating from the Illinois Institute of Technology in May 2020 with a master’s degree in Information Technology and Management with Data Management as my major. I am looking for internships and full-time analyst opportunities. I hope I am given an opportunity to prove to you that I possess the exact skill set and outlook you’re looking for.
