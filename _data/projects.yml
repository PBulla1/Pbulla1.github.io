      Built model using past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud and then used it to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.
      
      Applied Sampling techniques (Under Sampling and SMOTE) to resolve the imbalanced issue where 99.83% of the transactions in the data set were not fraudulent while only 0.17% were fraudulent. 
      
      Used Precision, Recall and F1-score to evaluate the results.
