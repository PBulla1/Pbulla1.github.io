    Have you ever used a credit card at a store only to be declined? Or have the payments been blocked because you were charged a higher amount. Credit Card Fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using a credit Card or any similar payment mechanism as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction.Despite the introduction of secure chip technology, credit card fraud remains a top concern for banks and financial institutions. A report published by “Nilson” shows that global credit card fraud losses equaled $22.8 billion in 2016.

      **Contributions:**
       Built model using past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud and then used it to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.
      
       Applied Sampling techniques (Under Sampling and SMOTE) to resolve the imbalanced issue where 99.83% of the transactions in the data set were not fraudulent while only 0.17% were fraudulent. 
      
       Used Precision, Recall and F1-score to evaluate the results.

      **Contributions:**
       Designed an end-to-end sales data warehouse using Pentaho DI and performed various transformations on the data (Row Normalizer, Database Lookup, if field value is null)
       
       Designed a database using Star Schema and built a multi-dimensional cube using Mondrian.
       
       Configured the Pentaho BI server to deploy reports by creating a database connection in Pentaho Enterprise Console for central usage. 
       
       Also, conducted analysis using the inbuilt Saiku Analytics Plugin and created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to demonstrate the results using pie chart, bar graphs, data blending feature and bubble charts.

      **Contributions:**
       Built a model that identifies the factors influencing the world happiness with 92% accuracy 
       
       Performed hypothesis test on the data set, built a regression model and performed predictive analysis using R.
       
       Used classification algorithms like KNN, Naïve Bayes and logistic regression to validate the results.
       
       Performed data cleansing and preprocessing using R statistical packages. 
       
       Used correlation matrix to evaluate the correlation among variables and then used N-fold cross evaluation.
       
       Performed back-ward elimination and eliminated variables that were greater than the p value(depending on confidence interval) at each step. 
       
       Also used predict() function to predict the variables that affected the most and RMSE (Root mean square error) to check the accuracy of the prediction.

     **Contributions:**
      Led a team of 5 members to develop a device that bridge the communication gap between deaf, mute children and other people. 
      
      Implemented it using embedded systems. LCD and APR voice modulator are interfaced with a microcontroller (Arduino Uno R3) and according to the values measured, coding is done using Embedded C.
      
      Also used Excel to generate user forms to obtain feedback on the project.
